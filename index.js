// 1. Arithmetic operations are constant
// 2. Variable assignment is constant
// 3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
// 4. In a Ioop, the the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop

// 路 To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
// 路 Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
// 路 Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
// 路 The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O)'
// depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
